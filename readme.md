Every player sent to the killing floor is asked to solve as many math problems as they can, in the form of 

- multiple-choice addition or subtraction with integers under 20 (negative answers are possible), 
- in a set interval of time. 
- If they get one incorrect, they are temporarily stunned, 
- meaning they lose a few seconds and have to wait to continue answering math problems. (How many seconds?)

If multiple players are in this minigame, the worst score (including all players tied for last) dies.
If one player is sent to this Killing Floor in a multiplayer game, all players play at the same time, and the at-risk player is killed if any safe player beats their score.
In a single or two player game, the player must answer 10, 15, or 20 questions correctly to survive. This number increases further in the game.
Players earn $25 for every math question answered correctly.
